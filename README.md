Changelog

- Removed embedded form and replaced with custom form that looks the same.
- The form data can be sent via api to where we need
- Currently, it's set up to send to the "make.com" testing automation where it runs through a playbook and gets sent to google drive sheets file. Would like to set up a db to store this data instead of sheets.
- Figured we dont need to use a third party app just to gather data off our website.
- Added validation of input email and name. (length, character types, valid email)
